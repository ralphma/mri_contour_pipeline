## Part 1 ##
#### How did you verify that you are parsing the contours correctly? ####
In order to make sure the contours are parsed correctly, I added unit tests for all methods in parsing.py. Run `pytest -q parsing.py` to run test suite.

#### What changes did you make to the code, if any, in order to integrate it into our production code base? ####

## Part 2 ##
#### Did you change anything from the pipelines built in Parts 1 to better streamline the pipeline built in Part 2? If so, what? If not, is there anything that you can imagine changing in the future? ####

#### How do you/did you verify that the pipeline was working correctly? ####
